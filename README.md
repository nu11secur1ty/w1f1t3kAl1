Wifite
======

This repo is a complete re-write of [`wifite`](https://github.com/derv82/wifite), a Python script for auditing wireless networks.

Wifite runs existing wireless-auditing tools for you. Stop memorizing command arguments & switches!

Wifite is designed to use all known methods for retrieving the password of a wireless access point (router).  These methods include:
1. WPS: The [Offline Pixie-Dust attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup#Offline_brute-force_attack)
1. WPS: The [Online Brute-Force PIN attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup#Online_brute-force_attack)<br>
   WPS: The [Offline NULL PIN attack](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x/wiki/Introducing-a-new-way-to-crack-WPS:-Option--p-with-an-Arbitrary-String)
2. WPA: The [WPA Handshake Capture](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html) + offline crack.
3. WPA: The [PMKID Hash Capture](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html) + offline crack.
4. WPA3: The [SAE Handshake Capture](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html) + offline crack.
5. WPA3: Transition mode downgrade attacks (force WPA2 on mixed networks).
6. WEP: Various known attacks against WEP, including *fragmentation*, *chop-chop*, *aireplay*, etc.
7. **Evil Twin**: Rogue AP attack with captive portal for credential capture.

Run wifite, select your targets, and Wifite will automatically start trying to capture or crack the password.

### Quick Start with Dual Interfaces

If you have two wireless adapters, wifite can use them simultaneously for significantly improved performance:

```bash
# Automatic dual interface mode (wifite detects and assigns interfaces)
sudo wifite --dual-interface

# Evil Twin attack with dual interfaces (30-50% faster)
sudo wifite --dual-interface --eviltwin

# WPA attack with dual interfaces (continuous capture, no packet loss)
sudo wifite --dual-interface --wpa

# Manual interface selection
sudo wifite --interface-primary wlan0 --interface-secondary wlan1
```

**Benefits:** Eliminates mode switching, enables parallel operations, improves reliability. See the [Dual Interface Guide](docs/DUAL_INTERFACE_GUIDE.md) for complete details.

### WPA3 Attack Support

Wifite now includes comprehensive WPA3-SAE attack capabilities with automatic detection and intelligent strategy selection.

#### WPA3 Attack Strategies

Wifite automatically selects the best attack strategy based on the target network:

1. **Transition Mode Downgrade (80-90% success rate)**
   - Automatically detects WPA2/WPA3 mixed networks
   - Forces clients to connect using WPA2 instead of WPA3
   - Captures standard WPA2 handshake for cracking
   - Fastest and most reliable method for transition mode networks

2. **SAE Handshake Capture (60-70% success rate)**
   - Captures WPA3-SAE authentication handshakes
   - Converts to hashcat format (mode 22000) for offline cracking
   - Works on pure WPA3 networks
   - Requires GPU for efficient cracking

3. **Passive Capture (50-60% success rate)**
   - Used when PMF (Protected Management Frames) is required
   - Waits for natural client reconnections
   - No deauthentication attacks possible
   - Slower but works on PMF-protected networks

4. **Dragonblood Exploitation (40-50% on vulnerable APs)**
   - Detects known WPA3 vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-13377, etc.)
   - Attempts timing-based attacks on vulnerable implementations
   - Automatically used when vulnerabilities detected

#### Basic WPA3 Usage

```bash
# Attack all networks including WPA3 (automatic detection)
sudo wifite

# Target only WPA3 networks
sudo wifite --wpa3-only

# Force SAE capture (skip downgrade attempts on transition mode)
sudo wifite --force-sae

# Disable downgrade attacks (pure SAE only)
sudo wifite --no-downgrade

# Check for Dragonblood vulnerabilities without attacking
sudo wifite --check-dragonblood
```

#### WPA3 Tool Requirements

For WPA3 support, you need these tools with minimum versions:

* **hcxdumptool v6.0.0+** - For capturing SAE handshakes
* **hcxpcapngtool v6.0.0+** - For converting SAE captures to hashcat format
* **hashcat v6.0.0+** - For cracking SAE hashes (mode 22000)

Install on Kali Linux:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install hcxdumptool hcxtools hashcat
```

**📖 For WPA3-specific troubleshooting, see [WPA3 Troubleshooting](docs/WPA3_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**

#### Understanding WPA3 Network Types

* **WPA3-only** - Pure WPA3 networks (requires SAE capture)
* **WPA3-Transition** - Mixed WPA2/WPA3 (downgrade attack possible)
* **PMF Required** - Protected Management Frames enabled (no deauth possible)
* **PMF Optional** - PMF supported but not required (deauth works)

Wifite automatically detects these configurations and selects the optimal attack strategy.

#### WPA3 Attack Examples

```bash
# Attack a specific WPA3 network by BSSID
sudo wifite -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF

# Attack WPA3 with custom timeout (default: 300 seconds)
sudo wifite --wpa3-timeout 600

# Crack captured WPA3 handshake with wordlist
sudo wifite --crack --dict /path/to/wordlist.txt

# Verbose mode to see WPA3 detection and strategy selection
sudo wifite -vv
```

#### WPA3 Troubleshooting

**No WPA3 networks detected:**
- Ensure your wireless adapter supports monitor mode on 5GHz (many WPA3 networks use 5GHz)
- Use `-5` flag to scan 5GHz channels
- Verify hcxdumptool is installed and up-to-date

**PMF prevents deauthentication:**
- This is expected behavior on WPA3 networks with PMF required
- Wifite automatically switches to passive capture mode
- Wait for natural client reconnections (may take longer)

**SAE handshake capture fails:**
- Ensure hcxdumptool v6.0.0+ is installed
- Check that clients are actively connecting to the network
- Try increasing timeout with `--wpa3-timeout`

**Hashcat cracking is slow:**
- WPA3-SAE cracking is computationally intensive
- Use GPU acceleration (CUDA/OpenCL) for best performance
- Consider using cloud-based cracking services for large wordlists


### Wireless Attack Monitoring

Wifite includes a passive wireless attack monitoring feature that detects and logs malicious 802.11 management frames such as deauthentication and disassociation attacks. This feature is useful for security researchers, network administrators, and penetration testers who need to assess the security posture of wireless environments.

#### What It Monitors

The attack monitor passively captures and analyzes:

* **Deauthentication Frames** - Frames used to forcibly disconnect clients from access points
* **Disassociation Frames** - Frames used to terminate client associations
* **Attack Patterns** - Identifies networks under attack and potential attacker devices
* **Network Statistics** - Tracks which networks are most frequently targeted
* **Attacker Profiles** - Identifies MAC addresses sending attack frames and their targets

#### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start attack monitoring (infinite duration)
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks

# Monitor for a specific duration (in seconds)
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks --monitor-duration 300

# Monitor a specific channel
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks --monitor-channel 6

# Enable channel hopping (monitor all 2.4GHz channels)
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks --monitor-hop

# Specify custom log file location
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks --monitor-log /path/to/attack_log.txt

# Use classic text mode instead of TUI
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks --no-tui
```

#### Understanding the TUI Display

When running in TUI mode (default), the attack monitor displays:

1. **Attack Statistics Panel**
   - Total deauthentication frames detected
   - Total disassociation frames detected
   - Number of unique networks under attack
   - Number of unique attacker MAC addresses
   - Monitoring duration

2. **Recent Attack Events Log**
   - Scrollable list of the last 100 attack events
   - Color-coded by attack type (red for deauth, orange for disassoc)
   - Shows timestamp, attack type, target network, and attacker MAC
   - Auto-scrolls to show newest events

3. **Networks Under Attack**
   - Top 20 most-attacked networks
   - Shows ESSID, BSSID, attack count, and last attack time
   - Sorted by attack count (most attacked first)

4. **Active Attackers**
   - Top 10 most active attacker MAC addresses
   - Shows MAC address, attack count, and number of targets
   - Sorted by attack count (most active first)

#### Log File Format

Attack events are logged in a structured format for easy analysis:

```
2025-10-30T15:23:45.123456 | DEAUTH | Attacker: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF | Target: 11:22:33:44:55:66 | BSSID: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF | ESSID: MyNetwork | Channel: 6
```

Each log entry includes:
- ISO 8601 timestamp with microsecond precision
- Attack type (DEAUTH or DISASSOC)
- Source MAC address (attacker)
- Destination MAC address (target client)
- BSSID (access point MAC)
- ESSID (network name, if available)
- Channel number

#### Tool Requirements

The attack monitoring feature requires:

* **tshark** (part of Wireshark) - For frame capture and analysis
  ```bash
  # Install on Kali/Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo apt install tshark
  
  # Install on Arch Linux
  sudo pacman -S wireshark-cli
  ```

* **Wireless adapter in monitor mode** - Wifite will automatically enable monitor mode
* **Root/sudo access** - Required for packet capture

#### Advanced Usage Examples

**Security Assessment:**
```bash
# Monitor your network for 1 hour to detect attacks
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks --monitor-duration 3600 --monitor-log security_audit.log

# Monitor with verbose output for debugging
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks -vv --monitor-log detailed_audit.log
```

**Penetration Testing:**
```bash
# Monitor a specific channel during a pentest
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks --monitor-channel 11 --monitor-log pentest_attacks.log

# Monitor target network's channel with custom interface
sudo wifite -i wlan1 --monitor-attacks --monitor-channel 6 --monitor-duration 1800
```

**Research and Analysis:**
```bash
# Monitor all channels to study attack patterns in an area
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks --monitor-hop --monitor-log research_data.log

# Long-term monitoring with timestamped logs
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks --monitor-hop --monitor-log "attacks_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log"
```

**Network Defense:**
```bash
# Continuous monitoring with automatic log rotation
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks --monitor-log /var/log/wifite/attacks_$(date +%Y%m%d).log

# Monitor specific channel in classic mode (no TUI, lower resource usage)
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks --monitor-channel 1 --no-tui --monitor-log attacks.log
```

**Incident Response:**
```bash
# Quick 5-minute scan to detect active attacks
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks --monitor-duration 300 --monitor-hop

# Monitor during a specific time window
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks --monitor-duration 7200 --monitor-log incident_$(date +%Y%m%d).log
```

**Compliance and Auditing:**
```bash
# Scheduled monitoring with detailed logging
sudo wifite --monitor-attacks --monitor-duration 3600 --monitor-log /var/log/compliance/wireless_$(date +%Y%m%d).log -vv

# Monitor specific interface and channel for compliance testing
sudo wifite -i wlan0mon --monitor-attacks --monitor-channel 6 --monitor-log compliance_audit.log
```

#### Interpreting Results

**High Attack Counts on Your Network:**
- May indicate an active penetration test or attack
- Could be a misconfigured device or rogue access point
- Investigate the attacker MAC address and correlate with authorized devices

**Multiple Networks Under Attack:**
- Suggests a widespread attack or scanning activity
- May indicate an attacker testing multiple targets
- Consider the physical location and signal strength

**Consistent Attacker MAC:**
- Single device attacking multiple networks
- May be a penetration testing tool or malicious actor
- Can be used to identify and locate the attacking device

**Periodic Attack Patterns:**
- May indicate automated tools or scheduled attacks
- Could be legitimate testing on a schedule
- Review timing patterns in the log file

#### Performance Considerations

**Resource Usage:**
- CPU: Minimal (tshark with filters is efficient)
- Memory: Low (event list limited to last 100 entries)
- Disk: Depends on attack frequency (logs are buffered and flushed periodically)

**Optimization Tips:**
- Use `--monitor-channel` to focus on specific channels for better performance
- Avoid channel hopping on busy networks to reduce CPU usage
- Use classic mode (`--no-tui`) on resource-constrained systems
- Regularly rotate log files to prevent excessive disk usage

**Scalability:**
- Handles high attack rates efficiently (1000+ frames/second)
- Network dictionary uses optimized lookups
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory bloat during long sessions

#### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I monitor attacks while running other wifite attacks?**
A: No, attack monitoring is a standalone mode. You cannot run `--monitor-attacks` simultaneously with other attack modes like `--wpa` or `--eviltwin`.

**Q: Will attack monitoring interfere with networks?**
A: No, attack monitoring is completely passive. It only captures and analyzes frames without sending any packets or interfering with network operations.

**Q: How accurate is the attack detection?**
A: Very accurate. The monitor detects genuine deauth/disassoc frames based on 802.11 frame types. However, some legitimate network operations may also use these frames (e.g., AP reboots, client roaming).

**Q: Can I monitor 5GHz networks?**
A: Yes, if your wireless adapter supports 5GHz monitor mode. Use `--monitor-channel` with a 5GHz channel number (e.g., 36, 40, 44, 48, etc.).

**Q: What's the difference between --monitor-channel and --monitor-hop?**
A: `--monitor-channel` focuses on a single channel for comprehensive monitoring, while `--monitor-hop` cycles through all 2.4GHz channels to detect attacks across the spectrum. Use `--monitor-channel` for targeted monitoring and `--monitor-hop` for area-wide surveillance.

**Q: How long should I monitor to get meaningful results?**
A: It depends on your goals. For quick assessment, 5-10 minutes may be sufficient. For comprehensive analysis, monitor for 30-60 minutes. For baseline establishment, consider 24-hour monitoring.

**Q: Can I analyze the log files programmatically?**
A: Yes, log files use a structured format with pipe-delimited fields, making them easy to parse with scripts, awk, grep, or import into databases/spreadsheets.

**Q: Does monitoring work on all wireless adapters?**
A: Any adapter that supports monitor mode will work. However, some adapters have better sensitivity and range, which affects detection capability.

**Q: What should I do if I detect attacks on my network?**
A: First, verify the attacks are unauthorized. If confirmed malicious, document the evidence, identify the attacker's location if possible, implement countermeasures (WPA3, PMF), and report to appropriate authorities if necessary.

**Q: Can attackers detect that I'm monitoring?**
A: No, passive monitoring is undetectable. Your wireless adapter only receives frames without transmitting anything.

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--wpasec` | Enable wpa-sec upload functionality | `--wpasec` |
| `--wpasec-key [key]` | Your wpa-sec.stanev.org API key | `--wpasec-key abc123...` |
| `--wpasec-auto` | Automatically upload without prompting | `--wpasec-auto` |
| `--wpasec-url [url]` | Custom wpa-sec server URL | `--wpasec-url https://custom.server` |
| `--wpasec-timeout [sec]` | Connection timeout in seconds (default: 30) | `--wpasec-timeout 60` |
| `--wpasec-email [email]` | Email address for notifications | `--wpasec-email you@example.com` |
| `--wpasec-remove` | Delete capture files after successful upload | `--wpasec-remove` |

#### Supported Capture Types

Wifite can upload all types of WPA/WPA2/WPA3 captures to wpa-sec:

* **WPA/WPA2 Handshakes** - Traditional 4-way handshake captures (.cap, .pcap, .pcapng)
* **PMKID Captures** - Clientless WPA2 attack captures (.pcapng format from hcxdumptool)
* **WPA3-SAE Handshakes** - WPA3 authentication captures (.pcapng)
* **Compressed Files** - Gzip-compressed captures (.gz)

**Note:** wpa-sec only accepts pcap/pcapng packet capture formats. Hash files (.22000) are not supported for upload.

#### Usage Examples

**Basic WPA attack with upload:**
```bash
sudo wifite --wpa --wpasec --wpasec-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

**PMKID attack with automatic upload:**
```bash
sudo wifite --pmkid --wpasec --wpasec-key YOUR_API_KEY --wpasec-auto
```

**WPA3 attack with email notifications:**
```bash
sudo wifite --wpa3-only --wpasec --wpasec-key YOUR_API_KEY --wpasec-email you@example.com
```

**Target specific network and upload:**
```bash
sudo wifite -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --wpasec --wpasec-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Dual interface mode with automatic upload:**
```bash
sudo wifite --dual-interface --wpasec --wpasec-key YOUR_API_KEY --wpasec-auto
```

#### Tool Requirements

WPA-SEC integration requires the `wlancap2wpasec` tool from the hcxtools suite:

```bash
# Kali Linux / Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt update && sudo apt install hcxtools

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S hcxtools

# Verify installation
wlancap2wpasec --version
```

**Note:** wlancap2wpasec is optional - wifite will work normally without it, but wpa-sec upload features will be unavailable.

#### Troubleshooting

**"wlancap2wpasec not found" error:**
* Install hcxtools package: `sudo apt install hcxtools`
* Verify installation: `which wlancap2wpasec`
* Ensure hcxtools is in your PATH

**"Invalid API key" error:**
* Verify your API key is correct (check wpa-sec.stanev.org)
* Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters
* API keys are case-sensitive

**"Upload failed: Connection timeout" error:**
* Check your internet connection
* Try increasing timeout: `--wpasec-timeout 60`
* Verify wpa-sec.stanev.org is accessible from your network

**"No handshake in capture file" error:**
* This is expected - wifite validates captures before upload
* Only valid handshakes/PMKIDs are uploaded
* Check capture quality with `tshark` or `aircrack-ng`

**Upload succeeds but file not removed:**
* Ensure you used `--wpasec-remove` flag
* Check file permissions in the capture directory
* Files are only removed after confirmed successful upload

#### Privacy and Security Considerations

**What Gets Uploaded:**
* Capture files containing handshakes/PMKIDs
* Target network BSSID and ESSID
* Your API key (for identification)

**What Does NOT Get Uploaded:**
* Your location or IP address (beyond what's in HTTP headers)
* Client device information
* Cracked passwords (you retrieve these from wpa-sec)

**Best Practices:**
* Only upload captures from authorized testing
* Use `--wpasec-remove` to avoid leaving sensitive files on disk
* Keep your API key secure - don't share it publicly
* Be aware that uploaded data is processed by a third-party service
* Review wpa-sec.stanev.org privacy policy and terms of service

**Legal Reminder:** Only upload captures from networks you own or have explicit written authorization to test. Uploading captures from unauthorized networks may be illegal in your jurisdiction.

#### Checking Results

After uploading, visit [wpa-sec.stanev.org](https://wpa-sec.stanev.org) to:
* View your submission history
* Check cracking progress
* Download cracked passwords
* Manage your API key and settings

If you provided an email address with `--wpasec-email`, you'll receive notifications when passwords are successfully cracked.

### Resume Feature

Wifite automatically saves your attack progress and allows you to resume interrupted sessions:

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Start an attack (progress is automatically saved)
sudo wifite

# If interrupted (Ctrl+C, crash, power loss), resume with:
sudo wifite --resume

# Resume the most recent session automatically:
sudo wifite --resume-latest

# Resume a specific session by ID:
sudo wifite --resume-id session_20250126_120000
```

#### How It Works
* **Automatic Saving** - Progress is saved after each target completion
* **Session Files** - Stored in `~/.wifite/sessions/` with secure permissions (600)
* **Smart Filtering** - Automatically skips completed and failed targets
* **Configuration Restore** - Preserves original attack parameters and settings
* **Multiple Sessions** - Manage multiple interrupted sessions with selection interface

#### Session Management
```bash
# List and choose from available sessions
sudo wifite --resume

# Clean up old session files (older than 7 days)
sudo wifite --clean-sessions
```

#### What's Saved
* Target list and attack progress
* Completed and failed targets
* Attack configuration (wordlist, timeouts, attack types)
* Original interface and settings

#### What's NOT Saved (for security)
* Captured passwords or keys
* Handshake files
* PMKID hashes

#### Troubleshooting

**Q: No session files found**
* Start a new attack first - sessions are created after target selection
* Check `~/.wifite/sessions/` directory exists and has proper permissions

**Q: Corrupted session file**
* Wifite will detect and offer to delete corrupted files
* Use `--clean-sessions` to manually remove problematic sessions

**Q: Interface changed**
* Wifite will detect if the original interface is unavailable
* You'll be prompted to use the current interface instead

**Q: Session not resuming correctly**
* Ensure you're using the same version of wifite
* Check that all required tools are still installed
* Use `--resume` to see session details before confirming

Performance Tips
-----------------

### For Best Results
* **Use a dedicated wireless adapter** - USB adapters often perform better than built-in cards
* **Position matters** - Get closer to target networks for better signal strength
* **Choose the right channel** - Use `-c <channel>` to focus on specific channels
* **Limit concurrent attacks** - Use `-first 5` to attack only the strongest targets first

### Speed Optimization
* **PMKID first** - Try `--pmkid` for fastest WPA/WPA2 attacks (no clients needed)
* **Skip WPS on modern routers** - Use `--no-wps` on newer routers that likely have WPS disabled
* **Use wordlists efficiently** - Start with common passwords, use `--dict <wordlist>`
* **WPA3 transition mode** - Downgrade attacks are faster than pure SAE capture
* **Target WPA2 first** - WPA2 is faster to crack than WPA3-SAE

### Resource Management
* **Monitor system resources** - Watch CPU and memory usage during long scans
* **Regular breaks** - Stop and restart wifite periodically during extended sessions
* **Clean up** - Remove old capture files and temporary data regularly

### Core Features
* **Less bugs**
   * Cleaner process management. Does not leave processes running in the background (the old `wifite` was bad about this).
   * No longer "one monolithic script". Has working unit tests. Pull requests are less-painful!
* **Speed**
   * Target access points are refreshed every second instead of every 5 seconds.
* **Accuracy**
   * Displays realtime Power level of currently-attacked target.
   * Displays more information during an attack (e.g. % during WEP chopchop attacks, Pixie-Dust step index, etc)
* **Educational**
   * The `--verbose` option (expandable to `-vv` or `-vvv`) shows which commands are executed & the output of those commands.
   * This can help debug why Wifite is not working for you. Or so you can learn how these tools are used.
* More-actively developed, with some help from the awesome open-source community.
* Python 3 support.
* Sweet new ASCII banner.


Troubleshooting
---------------

### Common Issues

**"Too many open files" error:**
- This has been fixed in v2.7.3 with enhanced process management
- If you still encounter this, try reducing concurrent attacks or restart wifite

**Permission denied errors:**
- Ensure you're running wifite with `sudo`
- Check that your wireless interface supports monitor mode
- Verify all required tools are installed and accessible

**Interface not found:**
- Run `sudo airmon-ng` to see available interfaces
- Use `sudo airmon-ng start <interface>` to enable monitor mode manually
- Some interfaces require specific drivers or firmware

**WPS attacks failing:**
- Ensure `reaver` and/or `bully` are installed and up-to-date
- Some routers have WPS disabled or rate-limiting enabled
- Try the `--pixie` flag for Pixie-Dust attacks specifically

**Handshake capture issues:**
- Ensure clients are connected to the target network
- Use `--num-deauths` to increase deauth attempts
- Some networks may require longer capture times

**WPA3 attack issues:**
- Verify hcxdumptool v6.0.0+ and hashcat v6.0.0+ are installed
- Check if PMF is preventing deauth attacks (wifite will notify you)
- For transition mode networks, downgrade attacks have highest success rate
- SAE handshake capture requires active client connections
- Use `-vv` to see detailed WPA3 detection and strategy information

**WPA3 cracking performance:**
- WPA3-SAE is significantly slower to crack than WPA2
- GPU acceleration is highly recommended (10-100x faster)
- Ensure hashcat is using your GPU: `hashcat -I` to list devices
- Consider starting with smaller, targeted wordlists

**Attack monitoring issues:**
- **tshark not found:** Install with `sudo apt install tshark` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo pacman -S wireshark-cli` (Arch)
- **No attacks detected:** Ensure your wireless adapter is in monitor mode and positioned to receive signals
- **Permission denied:** Run wifite with `sudo` - packet capture requires root privileges
- **High CPU usage:** Use `--monitor-channel` instead of `--monitor-hop` to reduce processing load
- **TUI not displaying:** Try classic mode with `--no-tui` or check terminal compatibility
- **Log file not created:** Verify write permissions for the log file path
- **Interface errors:** Ensure no other tools (airodump-ng, etc.) are using the interface

**Attack monitoring performance:**
- **Slow updates:** Normal on high-traffic channels - TUI updates every second
- **Missing events:** Ensure good signal strength to target networks
- **Memory usage growing:** Restart monitoring periodically during very long sessions (24+ hours)
- **Channel hopping too fast:** This is normal - cycles through all 2.4GHz channels every few seconds

### Getting Help

1. **Enable verbose mode:** Use `-v`, `-vv`, or `-vvv` to see detailed command output
2. **Check dependencies:** Run `wifite --help` to see if all tools are detected
3. **Update tools:** Ensure you have the latest versions of aircrack-ng, hashcat, etc.
4. **Check compatibility:** Verify your wireless card supports monitor mode and injection
